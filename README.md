# WhampsChallenge
The WhampsChallenge is a coding challenge which is inspired by the famous Wumpus-Game. 
The goal of a participant is to create a coded player (you could call it an AI) that navigates a little world, overcomes obstacles and finds gold.

The WhampsChallenge is split into several "Levels". 
With each level of the challenge the complexity of the game itself increases.
Each level a change is introduced or a new element is added to the game.
Ultimately you'll end up writing an AI for a complex, roguelike dungeon-crawler.

If you're interested in participating, soon the Wiki explains how to participate and explains the different language-dependent libraries that are supported.

If you're interested in writing a library for another language, just participate in this repository. The wiki also will soon contain an explanation on how to add your own library implementation.
